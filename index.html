 		<h1>Introduction</h1>
 		<p>I wanted to do this website without sharing any personal information so let's be a bit silly.</p>
 		<p>What is the bun you ask? The bun is the cutest baby ever and my mommy loves me soooo much that she can't stop blabbing about me even when she's doing a website.</p>

 		<h1>Why the bun?</h1>
 		<p>You know that expression, "a bun in the oven," well, my mommy used to say that to me when I was in her tummy and when I came out, she started calling me bun. Now everyone calls me bun!</p>

 		<h1>More About Me</h1>
 		<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
 		<p>I like eating off the floor, chewing on paper, and screaming at the top of my lungs when something dangerous is taken out of my hands.</p>
 		<h2>What will you be when you grow up?</h2>
 		<p>I think I'm going to be a drummer. I love to bang on everything I can get to.</p>
 		<h2>What's your family like?</h2>
 		<p>I have one mommy, and when she's not in my line of sight I scream in rage, one daddy, he's great but only if mommy is still right there, and two big furry friends who want to share my food.</p>
